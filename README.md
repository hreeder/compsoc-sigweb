SIG: Web, Making the Web(site) Great Again

## What is SIG: Web
SIG: Web is a Special Interest Group of CompSoc, centered around re-building the CompSoc website.

## Sounds good, what now?
This page lists some first ideas around what we might need/want for the website, until we can put together a first formal meeting, which will probably be late May / early June 2016.

## Join us <a href="https://www.irccloud.com/invite?channel=%23sigweb&amp;hostname=irc.imaginarynet.uk&amp;port=6697&amp;ssl=1" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.irccloud.com/invite-svg?channel=%23sigweb&amp;hostname=irc.imaginarynet.uk&amp;port=6697&amp;ssl=1"  height="18"></a>
We hang out in #sigweb on Imaginarynet (irc.imaginarynet.uk). You will find me (@hreeder) as `tbrb` in there.

## Ideas
What follows are some of the key features we have already identified for needs of the new website
* Must be easy to contribute to
* Must be easy to set up / deploy

With those ideas there, some technologies identified that could be of use:
* Docker (for ease of setting up, especially for contributors)
* Jekyll (Can you write text? Then you can contribute!)

I also think it might be nice to have a look at using Bourbon / Neat / Bitters / Refills alongside Sass for laying things out as well, but that's up for discussion :heart:
